S3
% Data Consistency Model is important in exam
% S3 is object-based - allows uploading of files
% for files only (no databases, OSs, applications, etc.)
% files can be 0B - 5TB
% unlimited storage
% files stored in buckets
% S3 is universal namespace - names must be unique globally
% example of bucket name: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
% Read after write consistency and eventual consistency (consistency models)
% S3 storage tiers - S3 standard, S3-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, Glacier
% Core fundamentals of S3 object - Key, Value, Version ID, Metadata, Subresources (ACL & Torrent)
% Read S3 FAQ before exam!
% Probably won't explore generating policies in exam
% Upload object to receive HTTP 200 code
% Encryption: client side (on your own computer, then upload to AWS), server side (with Amazon S3 Managed Keys - SSE-C, with KMS - SSE-KMS, with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C) 
% Control access to buckets using bucket ACL or Bucket Policies
% Buckets and the objects in them are private by default
% Versioning stores all versions of object (all writes and deletes)
% Versioning is a great backup tool
% Versioning cannot be disabled once enabled (but can be suspended)
% Integrates with Lifecycle rules
% MFA Delete can be used to provide additional layer of security
% Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
% Regions must be unique
% Files in existing bucket are not replicated automatically (but any subsequent updates will be)
% Cannot replicate to multiple buckets or do daisy chaining
% Delete markers are replicated
% Deleting individual versions/delete markers will not be replicated
% Understand Cross Region Replication at a high level
